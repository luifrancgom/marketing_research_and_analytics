-   This presentation is based on a business case taken from the course [Data Science for Business Part 1](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r) offered by the company [Business Science](https://www.business-science.io/) and adapted to be in line with the topics covered in [@chapman_r_2019]

# Purpose

## 

-   Deliver essential knowledge within a minimal timeframe by employing hands-on learning techniques to enhance productivity in the R programming language

# Business Case

##

-   You and your team will work for a corporation located in Wilton, Connecticut, United States that supplies bicycle frames and other components related to bicycles to different bicycle shops through the United States.

-   Your team is assigned to complete 2 tasks:

    -   Support the Research and Development (R & D) division in identifying potential new products and pricing them by using data collected from the bicycle shops.

    -   Support the marketing team in the creation of a marketing segmentation clustering model by using data collected from to the bicycle shops to offer more personalized products and messaging them.

-   Business unit: Cannondale Bicycle Corporation (Manufacturer)
    
    -   Location: USA
    -   Product: Bicycle frames
    -   Retailers: Bikeshops located through USA
    
        -   We are not going to analyze the business-to-customer (B2B) subchannel (Retailer to Customer) where the focus will be on the business-to-business (B2B) subchannel (Manufacturer to Retailer)
