[Disclaimer:]{style="color: red;"} Participants enrolled in the course will work in groups in a business case taken from the course [Data Science for Business Part 1](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r) offered by the company [Business Science](https://www.business-science.io/) and adapted to be in line with the topics covered in [@chapman_r_2019].

## Process in case of no presentation

-   Students who are unable to attend an oral presentation due to force majeure or illness must submit a scanned copy of their official excuse to [**luis.gomezl\@unimilitar.edu.co**](mailto:luis.gomezl@unimilitar.edu.co){.email}. Failure to provide a valid excuse will result in a zero grade for the presentation.

    -   If the excuse is approved, the absent student will be exempt from attending the oral presentation. Their grade will depend on their contribution to the group project:

        -   If the group confirms the absent student actively participated in the project's development throughout the designated three-week period, they will receive the same grade as the rest of the group.

        -   If the student was unable to participate due to the force majeure or illness, their grade will be equal to the grade they receive on the subsequent activity. If the absence occurred during the final oral presentation, their grade will be equal to the grade they receive on the second oral presentation. To receive this benefit, the student must actively participate in the development of at least 2 oral presentations.
